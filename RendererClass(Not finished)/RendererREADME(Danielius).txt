A class to render the loaded model.
Made by Danielius Zurlys

The purpose of the class is to render the model using OpenGL and glut.

Unfortunately, the class is not finished and currently can only render a square on the window.
No significant documentation currently present.

No CMakeLists are currently made to allow the build of Renderer class.

For now the class is only to be stored in a separate branch.

Possible further modifications in the future.

All files, required only by Renderer class are stored in a separate folder until then.
